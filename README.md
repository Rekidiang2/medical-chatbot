# medical-chatbot
The Medical Chatbot Project is an end-to-end RAG-based assistant that connects an LLM to a custom medical knowledge base. Built with LangChain, Pinecone, Hugging Face embeddings, and Flask, it delivers context-aware health insights. Deployed on AWS with CI/CD via GitHub Actions for real-world use.
